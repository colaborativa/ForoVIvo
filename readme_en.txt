What is ForoVivo?

Roundtables and discussions forums are great ways to share, learn, debate ideas and understand different points of view. Although sometimes covered topics are not properly defined or attendees don't have an option to participate and become engaged in the discussion.

ForoVivo is a web application which creates an online and participative prelude for any physical roundtable, debate or discussion. Speakers are invited to send a number of "ideas" or concepts prior the event. During a defined period of time those ideas can be read, voted and argued by anyone. Visitors are invited to send their ideas as well, the most voted ideas will be displayed together with the speakers' ones and could be included as part of the agenda of the physical event itself.

ForoVivo is licensed as open source so you can distribute, install and modify at your will. We will appreciate if you credit the source appropriately and would love to get some feedback if you are using it. The software have been used in real world scenarios and tested over a period of time, unfortunately we don't have enough resources to offer free support your installations. We are not responsible of any problem or misuse caused by the use of this software.
